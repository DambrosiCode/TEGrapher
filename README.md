# TEGrapher
An R package to help easily graph output files from the transposon annotation sofware [PoPoolationTE2](https://sourceforge.net/p/popoolation-te2/wiki/Home/) 
by authors Robert Kofler and Christian Schl√∂tterer. However, there isn't any reason the package can't be used in other applications for data such as
SNP or gene frequencies as long as the input file format is consistent.

## PoPoolationTE2
Briefly PoPoolationTE2 is a software program run on a Bash command line for detecting and annotating transposable element (TE) frequencies 
in a population generally with pool-seq data. The final output file consists of TE names, locations, and frequencies in the population, and further
analysis is left up to the user. For this I've developed a package in R to make analysis a bit less cumbersome. 

## Installation
